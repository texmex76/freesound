# Things I learned

- Be careful with naming and how python sorts. Solution here: natsort
- Be careful with reshaping images. Might botch them
- Avoid memory error in Keras: use fit_generator with ImageDataGenerator

Model with ~72% accuracy:

```python
Conv2D(32, (3,3), strides=1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1:]), activation='relu'),
Conv2D(64, (3,3), strides=1, activation='relu'),
MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=1, activation='relu'),
Conv2D(256, (3,3), strides=1, activation='relu'),
MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
Flatten(),
Dense(128, activation='relu'),
Dense(64, activation='relu'),
Dense(41, activation='softmax'),
```

# New approach

Combine different models

- Generate new training set $\rightarrow$ RGB or grayscale?
- If using RGB: modify model accordingly
- Implement EarlyStoppingMonitor and ReduceLROnPlateau
- Code for training each model separately
- Code for combining models
